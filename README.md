# Quick intro
📖 This project is documented in detail on [Codelogium](https://codelogium.github.io/projects/blockchain/landcertificate/), covering the architecture, client/admin workflow, QR code generation, and key learnings.

**landCertificate** is a Hyperledger blockchain admin/client land certficate requester application built on top of Hyperledger where clients request a land certificate to a land conserver(admin) who will deliver the certificate. Online [mongoDB-atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) is used to store clients' resquests, which are displayed in the admin panel.

A blockchain network that let's land conservers add its certificates in the blockchain, which can help against land ownership issues and problems.

The network was built using [Hyperledger Fabric V2.X.X](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) and the test were made on **_Linux/Debian 10 Buster_**, **_WSL/Debian 10 Buster_** and **_WSL/Ubuntu_** machines but should work on any given OS.
 
The web app is built with **_NodeJS_**, **_ExpressJS_**, **_REST API_** and **pug template** engine as a render for the front-end.

## Configuration and running
_**NB:** Having **_docker_** installed in one's OS is a **MUST**_.

**TL;DR** : _if you are familiar with hyperlegder fabric and have everything needed for it to run set up, move to _**landcertificate-network/landcertificate-starter/**_ and [run & execute the network](#commands-execute)_.

If you have never dealth with Hyperledger Fabric before, then you might want to grab the  version that suits well this project.<br>
Download the [sources of fabric-samples version-2.0.0 repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta) or grab them from  my [fabric-sample 2021's fork](https://github.com/alfahami/fabric-samples) and do the following:

**landCertificate** is built on top of Hyperledger Linux foundation, thus it's a must to install and configure Hyperledger first.

### Hyperledger installation and configuration

*Prerequisites*:
  - Install and configure Docker (tons of tutorial on the web, )
  - Install curl (`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` then `sudo apt install curl` on linux machine)

*Hyperledger*:
  - Run this single command to download and install the samples, binaries, and docker image of the latest production release of HL:

  - `curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s`
  - - if the above link is not working, download the [sources of fabric-samples version-2.0.0 repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta)
  - Find more details [Official HL documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/install.html)
  - Run the test-network as described in [using the test-network tutoriel](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/test_network.html) to make sure that everything is set up.

### landCertificate, installation and running
Now how so we start our HL network and get our web app running?

First and foremost, download or clone this repo.\
Repo structure:
   - **landcertificate-network/_** : contains our full blockchain application. It contains our config files, crypto materials, starter-app, chaincode ... etc.
  <blockquote>
  
  As Hyperledger has changed [fabric_samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples) folder content and structure, _**landcertificat-network/**_ has the necerssary binaries and tools- to build and run up our netwrork. Its content could also be found in the original [fabric-samples version-2.0.0 repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta) or grab them from  my [fabric-sample 2021's fork](https://github.com/alfahami/fabric-samples)
  </blockquote>
  
  - **_landcertificate-network/test-network/add_path_org1.sh_** : 
  a custom script that adds *peer cli*, *peer* and *fabric config* related path with org1's environment variables.\
  Copy this file (_**test-network/add_path_org1.sh**_) to **_fabric-samples/test-network_**.

  - **_landcertificate-network/chaincode/landcertificate/_**: contains our smart contract code (**_javascript/_**, **_java/_**) which will be packaged (chaincode), installed and committed to corresponding peers.\
  Copy the folder **_chaincode/landcertificate/_** to **fabric-samples/chaincode_**.\
  Open terminal and run `npm install` to install packages. 
  
  - **_landcertificate-network/certificate-starter/_** : contains our client application and is the starting point of our application.
    * **_startBcLand.sh_** is the script that is going to start our network, bringing up HL docker images, creating channel, packaging, installing and deploying our chaincode.\
    *Note* : We're deploying our chaincode by nitializing the ledger which consists of requesting and invoking a chaincode initialization function (initLedger).\
    Check the flag **_cci_** in `./network.sh deployCC -ccn certificate -ccv 1 -cci initLedger`\
    If you don't want to initialize the ledger, remove `-cci initLedger` from _startBCertificate.sh_

    * **_networkDown.sh_** will bring down our network, thus stopping running docker containers.\
    Note: If you're restarting the netowrk, you'll probably want to manually remove the chaincode docker volumes as they'll create conflict. (`docker volumes prune` would remove all your docker volumes)

    * **_javascript/_** is where we're going to *enroll ou admin*, *registrer our user* (so he/she can run transactions against the network by invoking the chaincode) and *querying the ledger* to get added certificates as we've deployed our chaincode while initializing it.\
    Run `npm install` before using any scripts. 

    * **_java/_** same as *javascript/*, contains our administration scripts.
    Not fully implemented and neither fully tested.

    * **_apiserver/_** is our nodeJS application. It contains same administration scripts in *javascript/* and more.\
    Run `npm install` before using any enrolling admin, registering the user and invoking transactions.
    
    * Copy **_landcertificate-network/certificate-starter/_** to **_fabric-samples/_**

<a name name="#commands-execute">_**Run & Execute Certificate**_</a>

Now that we went through all the folder and script let's see how we to start the app step by step :
  - Make sure you are in _**landcertificate-network/landcertificate-starter**_ run the following commands on your terminal:
    
    * `./startBcLand.sh` 
    * `cd apiserver/` 
    * `node enrollAdmin.js && node registerUser.js && node query.js`
    * `node apiserver.js` 
    * Now you can visit [http://localhost:8080/api/](http://localhost:8080/api/) or [http://localhost:8080/api/allcertificates](http://localhost:8080/api/allcertificates) to see already added certificates.

##### BLOCKCHAIN DIPLOMAS CERTIFICATE SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
If you find interest in this project.<br>
You might also look at a similar project that automates the issuance, dispatch, and management of university's digital credentials (diplomas, skills, transcripts, degree certifications, etc)  [here](https://github.com/alfahami/bcertificate).

<cite>Once again the main idea was to get familiar with how **Hyperledger Fabric** build and handles blockchain rahter than the user application and user experience.</cite>
